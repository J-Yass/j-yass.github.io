        <h1>The E - Chess Board Project</h1>
        <p>Welcome! This is a journal of my adventures in constructing an electronic chess board. The project goal is to play online games on Lichess.com on a physical board , like the DGT Chess Board. </p>
        <p>The project consists of two parts: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>electronic board</b>. For the board, I will use an Arduino UNO Rev3.</li>
            <li>The <b>user interface</b>. For the GUI, I will use Python 3 and API provided by Lichess.com.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>My original idea was to connect the e-board with Chess.com, but the Chess.com API doesn't provide support for playing online games. I have a computer science background; however, I have used Python mainly for Data Science, and I have never used it for GUI or API communication. Also, my knowledge of electronics is pretty basic, and I have never used Arduino. This is why I am recording every day on my project.</p>
