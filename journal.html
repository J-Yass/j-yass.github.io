                I started my intro to Arduino with the Starter Kit, on a MacBook Air M1. I followed the instructions on the book (an amazing book!) and downloaded the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" title="Arduino IDE Downloads">Arduino IDE</a> version 2.0.0. Currently, there is no native support for the ARM architecture on Mac M1, but the IDE works well under Rosseta2. The Arduino UNO comes with a USB A to USB B cable to connect to your computer. The MacBook Air M1 comes with only two ports, USB C.
                I already had a multiport adapter, so I used it. This was my initial configuration:

            <p>The test program was Blink, I executed it on the Arduino IDE but I got this error: <strong>avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding</strong>. I did a little troubleshooting but got the same error. Finally, I found a common solution: an original cable. So I bought one and yes! This time the program Blink worked!</p>

            <p>I had some trouble with the hardware: cables and other components; they are so small and difficult to put on the board. I hope to improve my manual skills.</p>
            <h4>Update!</h4>
            <p> Yesterday, before I tried the original cable, I restarted the machine. Today I test the flash written with the multiport adapter again, and worked well! Seems like the fix was only a restart :(</p>
